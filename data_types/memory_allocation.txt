we difind two diffrent type of data types:

1.primitive -string,number,boolean,null,undifined,bigint
2.refrence - array ,object and functions


* if we declare any primitive data type it directly goes to the stack.
* for refrence data type firstly it will go to heap memory then reference variable will pointer towards that location in stack.



example:

primitive:

let a=100
let b=a
b=200


Here we asign the a 's value  the b but I change the b value, so it so the value will change,because the two variables are stored in seprate location in the stack.

let user={
    name:"lalu",
    age:34,
}

let user2=user

Here the object store into the heap, if we asign the user object data in user2 , the location pointer show the location ,
which means , if i change anything in user it will reflect in user2 also.
