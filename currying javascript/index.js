We simply wrap a function inside a function, which means we are going to return a function from another function to obtain this kind of translation. The parent function takes the first provided argument and returns the function that takes the next argument and this keeps on repeating till the number of arguments ends. Hopefully, the function that receives the last argument returns the expected result.  

Note: An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, thatâ€™s why it is called currying.


Why is currying useful in JavaScript?

It helps us to create a higher-order function
It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.
It is very useful in building modular and reusable code
It helps us to avoid passing the same variable multiple times
It makes the code more readable

//  Currying in JavaScript transforms a function with multiple arguments into a nested series of functions, each taking a single argument. Currying helps you avoid passing the same variable multiple times, and it helps you create a higher order function

function newVal(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return function (c) {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}

console.log(newVal(2)(5)(3)); //10

function sum(a) {
  return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
      return a + b + c;
    };
  };
}
console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)); // 6

function calculateVolume(length) {
  return function (breadth) {
    return function (height) {
      return length * breadth * height;
    };
  };
}
console.log(calculateVolume(4)(5)(6)); //120
